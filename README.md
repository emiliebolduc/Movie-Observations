# Movie Observations

## Assigment
Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database. Load the information into an R dataframe.
Your deliverables should include your SQL scripts and your R Markdown code, posted to GitHub. This is by design a very open ended assignment. A variety of reasonable approaches are acceptable. You can (and should) blank out your SQL password if your solution requires it; otherwise, full credit requires that your code is “reproducible,” with the assumption that I have the same database server and R software.

## Observations1
I first tried to create 3 tables within a MySQL database with the thought that I would be able to coorelate them in R into one table. But I couldn't figure out how to do that.

## Observations2
I then resorted to creating one table within MySQL to upload into R.
