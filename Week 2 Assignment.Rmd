# Assignment
Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database. Load the information into an R dataframe.
Your deliverables should include your SQL scripts and your R Markdown code, posted to GitHub. This is by design a very open ended assignment. A variety of reasonable approaches are acceptable. You can (and should) blank out your SQL password if your solution requires it; otherwise, full credit requires that your code is “reproducible,” with the assumption that I have the same database server and R software.

# R Code Performed to Upload Results from a SQL Database in a R Dataframe
### Load RMySQL Package & Library
```{r}
library(RMySQL)
```

### Establish Connection (and Disconnet upon Exit)
```{r}
con <- dbConnect(MySQL(),
                 user="Test", password="Data607",
                 dbname="observations2", host="localhost")
```

### Show table in plain SQL
```{r}
sql <- "SELECT * from observations"
res <- dbGetQuery(con, sql)
res
```

### Disconnect from MySQL observations2 database
```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
